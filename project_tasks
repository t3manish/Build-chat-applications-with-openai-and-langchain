# Create a Q&A Chatbot with LangChain

## 📝 Case Description

LangChain is an advanced framework for developing language model-powered applications. A popular use case is creating customer support or Q&A chatbots. In this project, you will build a Q&A chatbot using Python and LangChain for the "Introduction to Tableau" course by Ned Krastev.

To achieve this, you'll employ **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**—a powerful technique for building AI-powered chatbots that provide accurate and contextual answers.

### ⚙️ The RAG Pipeline

This project is structured around the three core stages of a RAG pipeline:

1.  **Indexing:**
    *   The "Introduction to Tableau" course transcript is divided into shorter sections using LangChain's `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter` and token splitters.
    *   These sections are converted into numerical vectors (embeddings).
    *   The embeddings are stored in a **Chroma** vector store for efficient retrieval.

2.  **Retrieval:**
    *   A retriever is used to extract the most relevant sections of the course transcript based on a student's question.

3.  **Augmented Generation:**
    *   The chat model uses the retrieved text along with the student's original question to generate an "augmented" response.

The entire chain is implemented using the **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**, which allows for elegantly connecting components where the output of one serves as the input for the next.

### 🎯 Skills You Will Practice

This project will test your skills in:

*   Utilizing LangChain's text splitters.
*   Managing chat messages and chat prompt templates.
*   Applying LLMs and constructing LCEL chains.
*   Generating embeddings for storage in a vector store.
*   Constructing `RunnableLambdas` from Python functions.
*   Creating end-to-end LCEL chains for a Q&A chatbot.

#### Environment Setup

You are advised to create and work in a new environment specifically for this project.

*   **Python Version:** `3.9`

#### Required Packages

The following installations are required for this project. You can install them using `pip`.

*   `langchain==0.3.3`
    *   *Note: This will also install `langchain-core` and `langchain-text-splitters`.*
*   `langchain-chroma==0.1.4`
